💻 Experience

Junior Full-Stack Developer at Tabletop Manager

I lead the development on a portfolio website and passion project called "Tabletop Manager," a comprehensive web app designed for tabletop game enthusiasts. This project is designed to challenge me to manage every aspect of the application, from UI/UX design to backend development, to database management and to documentation.
With this project I strive to prepare myself for a Full Stack Developer role to better understand the challenges and rewards building a project such as this can bring. The work on this project will be ongoing, I wish to learn more about web development so that someday I can
roll out a version of this application that I can be truly proud and that others can get some use out of.
